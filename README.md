While starting to code for any new application we are required to write POCO (Plain Old CLR Objects) classes for our database tables as Models (if you are using any ORM for data access). The process is simple but most of time repetitive and just like other developers I try to avoid it, so I wrote this simple windows forms application which helps me create database tables of POCO/model classes for the database tables in order to use with EntityFramework Code First ORM framework (which I mostly use in my web applications). This saves time and helps me to avoid writing repetitive code.

This application is primarily targeting databases designed in SQL Server.
